## 2026-10-30 06:15 IST — People / Time & Leave — land #46 and #47
- Did: #46 (Joining & leaving) merged into main after conflict fixes (Tasks panel moved to lifecycle pageTasks). #47 (Leave policy rules) merged with origin/main: kept #68's canAct gating in My leave beside hourly leave and preview notes; leave_policy_rules migration renamed to 20261108100000 so it sorts after main's newest (20261107090300).
- Evidence: #46 merge 1367b260. #47 merge commit 3f85d62f. Server leave/portal tests 21 files, 175 passed (connection_limit=5, one worker). `npm run test:web` 1887 passed after the local lucide-react install was brought to the lockfile's 1.61 (the one failure was a stale local 1.41).
- Next: merge #47 when verify/audit/secrets pass; read docs/TEAM.md; People audit batches 5 and 6.
- Blocked on: nothing
